# Hashtag Diversification Fix Summary

## Issue
The Discord bot was not properly changing hashtags on retry attempts because the `used_hashtags` parameter was always being passed as an empty set (`set()`) to the search strategy functions.

## Root Cause
In `discord_bot.py`, the `scrape_tiktok_videos_simplified` function was passing `used_hashtags=set()` for every attempt, which meant:
1. The search strategies never knew which hashtags were already tried
2. The hashtag diversification logic in `get_diversified_hashtags()` was never triggered
3. Retry attempts used the same hashtags as the first attempt

## Fix Applied
1. **Modified `discord_bot.py`**:
   - Added persistent `used_hashtags = set()` before the retry loop
   - Pass the same `used_hashtags` set to all retry attempts
   - Added logging to show when hashtag diversification is happening

2. **Enhanced `search_strategies.py`**:
   - Added `used_hashtags.add(hashtag)` tracking in parallel strategy
   - Added `used_hashtags.add(hashtag)` tracking in sequential strategy
   - Added `used_hashtags.add(hashtag)` tracking in hashtag_only strategy
   - Ensured all strategies properly track which hashtags they use

## How It Works Now
1. **First attempt (retry_attempt=0)**: Uses standard/popular hashtags
2. **Retry attempts (retry_attempt>0)**: 
   - Receives the accumulated `used_hashtags` set
   - `get_diversified_hashtags()` filters out already-used hashtags
   - Prioritizes diverse/niche hashtags over popular ones
   - Randomizes order to break algorithmic patterns
   - Returns completely different hashtags

## Test Results
âœ… Hashtag diversification test shows:
- First attempt: Uses popular hashtags (`fyp`, `viral`, `trending`)
- Second attempt: Uses diverse hashtags (`mixing`, `memetrend`, `cookingtips`)
- **Zero overlap** between attempts
- 425 diverse hashtags available for retry attempts

## Benefits
- Retry attempts now use different content sources
- Reduces likelihood of getting duplicate/similar videos
- Better content diversity across multiple search attempts
- Avoids TikTok's algorithmic clustering of similar content
